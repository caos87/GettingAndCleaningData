# Variables
1. x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain data from the corresponding datasets from the original files
2. x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the (subsets of) original datasets
3. features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in mean_and_std_features. Activities variables are handled the same way.
4. all_data merges x_data, y_data and subject_data.
5. "average_data.txt" contains the means asked for by the project.
